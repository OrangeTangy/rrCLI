# Robot Raconteur CLI Tool  

## Overview  
This project is a command-line interface (CLI) tool for interacting with [**Robot Raconteur**](https://robotraconteur.github.io/robotraconteur/doc/core/latest/getting_started/).  

It is inspired by ROS 2â€™s `ros2cli` and aims to provide similar functionality for Robot Raconteur services. The tool will allow developers to:  

- Discover available services on the network  
- Inspect service types and members  
- Call service functions and interact with objects  
- *(Future goal)* Detect common networking/firewall issues  

The CLI will be designed with a **plugin system** so new commands can be added easily.
